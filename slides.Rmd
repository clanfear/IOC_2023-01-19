# Community Crime Theories

---

# Broken Windows

[Wilson & Kelling (1982)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/) describe a system where community disorder (1) increases crime by 
signalling low social control to offenders and (2) decreases actual social control by reducing willingness to use public spaces.
--

.pull-left-60[

![Broken Windows](img/broken_windows_pretty.svg)

]

.pull-right-40[
* A: Disorder signals low guardianship which increases offending.

* B, E: Disorder and crime constrain social relations and impede control.

* C, D: Social control inhibits both disorder and crime.
]

.centernote[
*A theoretical basis for order maintenance policing*
]

## Keizer, Lindenberg, & Steg (2008)

Keizer et al. used disorder manipulations and recorded norm violation with field experiments in Groningen, the Netherlands. 

Multiple types of disorder consistently increased in norm violation.

* Powerful causal effect of disorder on multiple forms of norm violation (A).

* High **internal validity** from experimental design.

* Single sites in one city.

.centernote[
*Seemingly strong evidence for the direct path*
]

# Collective Efficacy

[Sampson & Raudenbush (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1086/210356) contend that disorder and crime are both manifestations of low collective efficacy—the community's capacity for informal social control.
--

.pull-left-60[
![Collective Efficacy](img/collective_efficacy_pretty.svg)
]

.pull-right-40[
* A: Disorder has no direct impact on crime.

* C, D: Disorder and crime are products of low collective efficacy—social control—which is exogenous (B, E).
]

.centernote[
*A, B, and E represent testable constraints on Broken Windows.*

# Consistency

A mismeasurement: Different types of treatment treated as the same

.image-75[
![](img/po_consistency.svg)
]

Commonly violated in field experiments *and* observational research

* e.g., scales combining different treatments<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] see [VanderWeele (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0000000000001434)]

---

## Consistency: Asymmetry

Occurs when treating and removing treatment has different effects

.image-75[
![](img/po_consistency2.svg)
]

--

Nearly all studies assume symmetry—but reality is often asymmetric<sup>1</sup>

* *Pulling the knife out doesn't heal the wound*
* Control conditions may *alter existing states*

.footnote[[1] See Lieberson (1985) *Making it Count*]

---

# Interference

Interference means some units' treatments influence other units' outcomes

.image-75[
![](img/po_interference.svg)
]

--

These spillovers are common in the real world: What happens nearby matters

---

# Interference

Interference gets complicated quickly

.image-75[
![](img/po_interference2.svg)
]

--

Can often be ruled out in experiments

* But real processes have spillovers
* Large-scale shocks or policies have unanticipated effects<sup>1</sup>

Key Findings:

.footnote[[1] No significant positive relationship in *any* of the 20 locations]
--

* Disorder **reduces mailing**

* Thefts higher where **prior disorder** is present, but no difference in treatment effect

* Collective efficacy predicts less **theft** and **prior disorder**
